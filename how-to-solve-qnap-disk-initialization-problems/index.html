Every now and then I <em>need</em> linux. I simply doâ€¦ And on those moments we both throw down for a spectacular fight and see who comes out on top.</p><p>This weekend was no different. As a thank you gift for some services rendered I received a <a href="http://http://www.qnap.com/nl/?lang=nl&amp;sn=531&amp;c=310&amp;sc=577&amp;t=586&amp;n=3613">QNAP TS-219P+</a> that I had big plans for. I have 2 external drives, one for media and one for incremental backups so sticking them into the NAS would surely ease my daily routines.</p><p>Dismanteling the drives wasnâ€™t all that challenging and before no time the first disk was installed in the NAS. I decided to start with just one disk (the media one), because it didnâ€™t hold any important data anyway and I was unsure if the NAS needed to format the drives in order to use them.</p><p>I ran the first use utility and the set-up was pretty straight forward. Since I donâ€™t really like <a href="http://http://www.raidrecoveryonline.com/jbod_raid/">JBOD</a> I opted to let the NAS skip RAID and just view each tray as a single disk. In retrospect this was a bad move :(</p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>Once I had the NAS set up and was done moving all my data to the NAS I dismanteled the remaining drive and popped it in the NAS. I tried <strong>hot plugging</strong> it to see if the NAS would go for it and surely it did. Wellâ€¦ <em>sort ofâ€¦</em></p><p>Whatever I tried, the NAS would refuse to initialize the drive! It would just keep telling me:</p><blockquote><p><code>[Singe Disk Volume: Drive 2] Formatting failed.</code></p><p><code>[Singe Disk Volume: Drive 2] Formatting failed(Cannot unmount disk).</code></p></blockquote><p>None of QNAPâ€™s own documentation seemed to work as well as standard LINUX stuff. I later learned that QNAP operates on a slightly modded version of <a href="http://http://www.busybox.net/">BUSYBOX</a></p><h2 id="the-fix">The fix</h2><p>The fix was relatively simple, but I had to use steps from various other fixes (maily from people having problems with JBOD).</p><ol><li>Connect to the NAS with <a href="http://http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">SSH</a> (<strong>NOTE: you can only SSH into the NAS with the admin account - admin / password</strong>)</li><li>Stop all the running services with the following command <code>/etc/init.d/services.sh stop</code></li><li>Format the drive with ONE, and <strong>ONLY ONE</strong> partition using <a href="http://http://www.ehow.com/how_1000631_hard-drive-linux.html">fdisk</a>. You should be presented with the <em>error 16</em> when you reach the final step and attempt to write the changes</li><li><strong>POWER DOWN</strong> the NAS. Do not reboot instead. I you reboot the disk will remain unitialized.</li><li>After powering back up, log into the web interface and navigate to storage manager. The second disk should now say that it is not yet mounted. <strong>DO NOT</strong> attempt to mount the disk from SSH as this will just show errors and will force you to power down again.</li><li><strong>FORMAT</strong> the drive from the webinterface. It will automatically mount everything as it sees fit and you should end up with a mounted usable second drive.</li></ol><p>I hope this will help some of you that are facing the same annoying issue I was facing. youâ€™ve been a worthy foe linux. I will see you again soon for our next battle.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/tag/busybox/">busybox</a></li><li><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/tag/fdisk/">fdisk</a></li><li><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/tag/linux/">linux</a></li><li><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/tag/nas/">nas</a></li><li><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/tag/qnap/">qnap</a></li><li><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/tag/ssh/">ssh</a></li><li><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/tag/troubleshooting/">troubleshooting</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://words.vanderbasch.com/media/website/avataaars.png" loading="lazy" alt="Bonno van der Basch"><h3><a href="https://words.vanderbasch.com/author/bvdbasch/" title="Bonno van der Basch">Bonno van der Basch</a></h3><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Bonno! ðŸ‘‹ I make cool stuff from code.
