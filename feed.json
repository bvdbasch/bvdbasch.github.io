Knowing how hard some things are to do with the first iteration of a programming language you really come to appreciate the advancements in modern (iterations of) programming languages. Arrow functions in JavaScript are a great example of this, so I figured I would illustrate how much easier they make life.</p><h2 id=\"without-mapping-and-arrow-functions\">Without mapping and arrow functions</h2>\n<p>Let’s say that you want to create a greeter that greets all names in an array. Performing this without mapping and arrow functions takes a few lines of codes and requires us to use a loop structure. <em>Note that I use</em> <code>var</code> <em>and</em> <code>alert()</code> <em>on purpose here, because</em> <code>let</code> <em>and</em> <code>console.log()</code> <em>were not around at the time of ECMAScript 1</em> 😢</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var transformed = [];\nvar names = [&#39;Peter&#39;, &#39;Florian&#39;, &#39;Dion&#39;, &#39;Michiel&#39;, &#39;Joachim&#39;];\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; names.length; i++) {\n​    transformed.push(&#39;Howdy &#39; + names[i] + &#39;!&#39;);\n}\n\nalert(transformed);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"with-mapping-and-arrow-functions\">With mapping and arrow functions</h2>\n<p>Thanks  to the new capabilities in ECMAScript we can do the above in a single line of code and no longer have to concern ourselves with writing a loop. NICE!</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let names = [&#39;Peter&#39;, &#39;Florian&#39;, &#39;Dion&#39;, &#39;Michiel&#39;, &#39;Joachim&#39;];\nlet transformed = names.map((name) =&gt; { return `howdy ${name}!` });\nconsole.log(transformed);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Much easier and pretty straightforward. I hope that after reading this you appreciate the tools you have at your disposal today. And although there are still plenty of things with room for improvement I would hate to have go back and lose all those improvements we have access to today 🙃</p>",

Well, for most modern keyboards this would no longer be the case, but that's why I love vintage tech; not only are all the screws much bigger than those we see nowadays, but there is also a clear absence of proprietary components. Everything is just sorta... <i>out there in the open</i>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The two pictures below sum up the process nicely, basically you unscrew the mounting screws located at the bottom of the keyboard and then detach the metal base, after which you get unrestricted access all the innards of the keyboard.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"2\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://words.vanderbasch.com/media/posts/5/gallery/BTC-5300-top-half-reveal.jpg\" data-size=\"5376x3024\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://words.vanderbasch.com/media/posts/5/gallery/BTC-5300-top-half-reveal-thumbnail.jpg\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://words.vanderbasch.com/media/posts/5/gallery/BTC-5300-bottom-half-reveal.jpg\" data-size=\"5376x3024\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://words.vanderbasch.com/media/posts/5/gallery/BTC-5300-bottom-half-reveal-thumbnail.jpg\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n    <h3 id=\"cleaning\">\n      Cleaning\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Normally I would just use denture cleaning tablets on keyboards as severely yellowed as this one, but seeing as how my fallback plan was to just take the keycaps and run I did not want to risk damaging the keycaps, so instead I opted for multiple soaking sessions in lukewarm water with a tiny amount added.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I did three soaking sessions in total and ever so gently rubbed off all the nasty.

Every now and then I <em>need</em> linux. I simply do… And on those moments we both throw down for a spectacular fight and see who comes out on top.</p><p>This weekend was no different. As a thank you gift for some services rendered I received a <a href=\"http://http://www.qnap.com/nl/?lang=nl&sn=531&c=310&sc=577&t=586&n=3613\">QNAP TS-219P+</a> that I had big plans for. I have 2 external drives, one for media and one for incremental backups so sticking them into the NAS would surely ease my daily routines.</p><p>Dismanteling the drives wasn’t all that challenging and before no time the first disk was installed in the NAS. I decided to start with just one disk (the media one), because it didn’t hold any important data anyway and I was unsure if the NAS needed to format the drives in order to use them.</p><p>I ran the first use utility and the set-up was pretty straight forward. Since I don’t really like <a href=\"http://http://www.raidrecoveryonline.com/jbod_raid/\">JBOD</a> I opted to let the NAS skip RAID and just view each tray as a single disk. In retrospect this was a bad move :(</p><h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Once I had the NAS set up and was done moving all my data to the NAS I dismanteled the remaining drive and popped it in the NAS. I tried <strong>hot plugging</strong> it to see if the NAS would go for it and surely it did. Well… <em>sort of…</em></p><p>Whatever I tried, the NAS would refuse to initialize the drive! It would just keep telling me:</p><blockquote>\n<p><code>[Singe Disk Volume: Drive 2] Formatting failed.</code> </p><p><code>[Singe Disk Volume: Drive 2] Formatting failed(Cannot unmount disk).</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>None of QNAP’s own documentation seemed to work as well as standard LINUX stuff. I later learned that QNAP operates on a slightly modded version of <a href=\"http://http://www.busybox.net/\">BUSYBOX</a></p><h2 id=\"the-fix\">The fix</h2>\n<p>The fix was relatively simple, but I had to use steps from various other fixes (maily from people having problems with JBOD).</p><ol>\n<li>Connect to the NAS with <a href=\"http://http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\">SSH</a> (<strong>NOTE: you can only SSH into the NAS with the admin account - admin / password</strong>)</li>\n<li>Stop all the running services with the following command <code>/etc/init.d/services.sh stop</code></li>\n<li>Format the drive with ONE, and <strong>ONLY ONE</strong> partition using <a href=\"http://http://www.ehow.com/how_1000631_hard-drive-linux.html\">fdisk</a>. You should be presented with the <em>error 16</em> when you reach the final step and attempt to write the changes</li>\n<li><strong>POWER DOWN</strong> the NAS. Do not reboot instead. I you reboot the disk will remain unitialized.</li>\n<li>After powering back up, log into the web interface and navigate to storage manager. The second disk should now say that it is not yet mounted. <strong>DO NOT</strong> attempt to mount the disk from SSH as this will just show errors and will force you to power down again.</li>\n<li><strong>FORMAT</strong> the drive from the webinterface. It will automatically mount everything as it sees fit and you should end  up with a mounted usable second drive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope this will help some of you that are facing the same annoying issue I was facing. you’ve been a worthy foe linux. I will see you again soon for our next battle.</p>",

Na een tijd gespeeld te hebben met een standaard Logitech deskset (waar op zich niets mis mee is) besloot ik toch op zoek te gaan naar wat serieuzer werk. Vroeger zat ik hoofdzakelijk achter mijn PC voor huiswerk en wat Photoshop, maar tot enige tijd geleden ben ik echt heel serieus met PC gaming bezig geweest en heb ik zelfs in een team/competitie meegespeeld.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Goed, na heel veel google-en viel mijn oog op de volgende toetsenbord en muis combinatie: de <a href=\"http://www.roccat.org/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/ROCCAT-Arvo/\" target=\"_blank\">ROCCAT Arvo</a> met de <a href=\"http://www.esportnova.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=172\" target=\"_blank\">Nova Slider X600</a>. Deze combinatie heb ik geruime tijd met plezier gebruikt en hoewel ze in mijn ogen perfect zijn om mee te gamen, zijn ze ook niet meer dan dat. Sterker nog, mijn Arvo toetsenbord verving ik al vrij snel door een <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/sidewinder-x6-keyboard#details\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Sidewinder X6</a> omdat het toetsenbord mij bij alles wat niet met gaming te maken had tot pure waanzin dreef. Als het gaat om het kiezen toetsenbord/muis/muismat is is het belangrijkste element toch wel persoonlijke voorkeur en ik heb altijd gevonden dat Microsoft toetsenborden heerlijk aanvoelen. Toen Microsoft met een degelijk gaming keyboard op de markt kwam was voor mij dat ook de keuze snel gemaakt :)\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Mijn Nova hield het langer vol, maar de laatste paar maanden kwam ook daarvan naar voren dat het beestje zich toch het beste voelde tijdens het gamen. De muisknoppen zijn op een bijzondere manier gefabriceerd, waardoor heel snel herhaaldelijk klikken (voor de gamers die dit lezen: <i>optimized for burst fire</i>) een makkie is. Maar, het vasthouden van de muisknop voor simpelere zaken zoals tekst selecteren en het <i>drag- en droppen</i> van bestanden is iets dat daardoor veel meer inspanning vergt. Dit uit zich in het begin als kleine frustraties, maar naarmate het gamen afnam en het 'normale' Windows gebruik toenam groeide deze uit tot regelrechte ergernis.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Daarom een paar maanden geleden toch maar besloten om op zoek te gaan naar een waardige vervanger. Na heel veel google-en en heel veel muisjes betasten heb ik gisteren dan toch eindelijk de knoop doorgehakt en gekozen voor een <a href=\"http://steelseries.com/products/mice/steelseries-ikari-laser\" target=\"_blank\">Steelseries Ikari laser</a>. Een heerlijke muis, die een ongekend comfort biedt. Ik heb tot nu toe nog steeds geen muis vastgehouden die lekkerder aanvoelt dan deze. Begrijp me niet verkeerd, als ik naar een LAN ga weet ik zeker dat ik altijd mijn Nova mee zal slepen. Er IS gewoon geen muis die ook maar in de buurt komt van de perfect gevonden balans tussen functie en comfort (als het op gamen neerkomt) van de Nova. Niet voor niets zijn er ook al een aantal <a href=\"http://www.ozonegaming.com/product.php?id=2\" target=\"_blank\">low budget copycats</a> van de Nova op de markt verschenen. Maar als het gaat om thuis werken: een Steelseries Ikari? Ik wil niets anders meer!\n  </p>",
